To reproduce the tables and figures in Lee(2008):

1. Download the 'public_use' program and the five data files
	(figure1.dta, group_final.dta, individ_final.dta, 
	table_one_final.dta, and table_two_final.dta) to a 
	unique folder or directory.
	Note: these data files are created in a proprietary
	data preparation program that is not available for 
	public use.

2. Create a folder called 'final' in the new folder/directory.
	The tables and figures generated by 'public_use' will
	be saved in this folder.

3. Run the program in Stata.

4. Table One (saved as './final/table1.csv') will require additional
	formatting in Excel - specifically, the column headers
	need to be changed as follows:
		Col_1: All - winner
		Col_2: All - loser
		Col_3: |Margin|<.5 - winner
		Col_4: |Margin|<.5 - loser
		Col_5: |Margin|<.05 - winner
		Col_6: |Margin|<.05 - loser
		Col_7: Parametric fit - winner
		Col_8: Parametric fit - loser

	The rows are ordered as they appear in the published version
	of the paper - an 'm' at the end of the variable name signifies 
	'mean'; an 'se' signifies 'standard error'; and an 'sd' signifies
	'standard deviation.'

	The variable names refer to:
		demsharenext: Democrat vote share election t+1
		demwinnext: Democrat win prob. election t+1 
		demshareprev: Democrat vote share election t-1
		demwinprev: Democrat win prob. election t-1
		demofficeexp: Democrat political experience
		othofficeexp: Opposition political experience
		demelectexp: Democrat electoral experience	
		othelectexp: Opposition electoral experience
